📌Java Fundamentals
Exceptions allow you to handle errors during program execution without causing it to stop abruptly.

Exception Types:
Checked: Must be handled (e.g., IOException).

Unchecked: Cannot be caught (e.g., NullPointerException).

📚 Collections
The java.util package provides dynamic data structures for storing and manipulating objects.

Common Examples:
List (ArrayList, LinkedList)

Set (HashSet, TreeSet)

Map (HashMap, TreeMap)

🧩 Generics
Allow you to define classes, interfaces, and methods with generic types, avoiding runtime errors and promoting reusable code.

📁 File Handling
Java allows you to create, read, and write files using java.io classes.
